  summary: Claim Server
  operationId: ClaimServer
  description: |
    Claims this Dedicated Server if it is not claimed. Requires InitialAdmin privilege level, which can only be acquired by attempting passwordless login while the server does not have an Admin Password set, e.g. it is not claimed yet. Function does not return any data in case of success, and the server is claimed. The client should drop InitialAdmin privileges after that and use returned AuthenticationToken instead, and update it's cached server game state by calling QueryServerState.
